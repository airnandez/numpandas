# README

## Overview
This repository contains a set of tutorials prepared for helping students get started analysing data using tools of the Python ecosystem.

Each tutorial is presented as an independent Python notebook: familiarity with Python is expected to follow them. We recommend to study the tutorials in the following order:


|     |  Notebook             | Google Colab   | Binder   |
| --- |:----------------------| -------------- | -------- |
| **1.**   | [NumPy](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/airnandez/numpandas/blob/master/notebooks/NumPy.ipynb) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/airnandez/numpandas/blob/master/notebooks/NumPy.ipynb) | [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/airnandez/numpandas/master?filepath=notebooks%2FNumPy.ipynb) |

## How to run these notebooks in your computer

To run the notebooks of this repository on your own computer, you need a working Python environment which includes:

* [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) 
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
* [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

The notebooks were verified to work with Python v3.7 and should work with more recent versions. We **strongly recommend** to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution, which already includes all the packages needed to execute these notebooks.

To execute these notebooks in your own environment proceed as shown below:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/airnandez/numpandas.git
$ cd numpandas
$ jupyter lab
```

You will find the notebooks ready to run in the `notebooks` directory.
