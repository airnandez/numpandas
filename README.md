# README

## Overview
This repository contains a set of tutorials prepared for helping students get started analysing data using tools of the Python ecosystem. Each tutorial is presented as an independent Python notebook and familiarity with Python is expected to follow them. We recommend to study them in the following order:


|     |  Notebook             | Google Collab  | Binder   |
| --- |:----------------------| -------------- | -------- |
| **1.**   | [NumPy](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/airnandez/numpandas/blob/master/notebooks/NumPy.ipynb) | [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/airnandez/numpandas/blob/master/notebooks/NumPy.ipynb) | [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/airnandez/numpandas/master?filepath=notebooks%2FNumPy.ipynb) |

## How to run these notebooks

To run the notebooks of this repository on your own environment, you need a working Python environment which includes:

* [NumPy](https://www.numpy.org) 
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/)
* [Jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#)

The notebooks were verified to work with Python v3.7. We **strongly recommend** to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) distribution, which already includes all the packages needed to execute these notebooks.

If you want to execute these notebooks in your own environment, proceed as shown below:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/airnandez/numpandas.git
$ cd numpandas
$ jupyter lab
```
